# My Google Fivers Adventure
This is the code I used to create my submission for creativelab5.com (06/2016)

It's not very well documented and only useful and understandable for people who took the same code & break approach like me.

## Final Submission
I'm a coder so of course it's less beautiful but more hack'ish ðŸ¤“
